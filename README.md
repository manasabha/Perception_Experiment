The experiment aims to research enhancing the challenging experience of the target selection task on a mobile phone by understanding the key factors and the connections between the finger-touch side and the target-display side on the VR app. The statistical analysis on information collected from test participants can help to design better mobile VR applications using devices like the Homido Mini VR Glasses. 

In order to perform the experiment a VR Android Application was designed using the Unity. There were virtual cubes floating in the air, and a non-clickable plane was provided for reference. Only one cube would be seen at the same time. The user could select the cube by land-on (i.e., tapping the cube to select), or lift-off (i.e., select the cube while lifting the finger) action. The cube would change its color as a feedback for a successful selection.
